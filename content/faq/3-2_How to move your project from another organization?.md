If your project is already hosted by another organization, but you would like to transfer it to OMSF, please reach out to us to discuss the potential transition. The exact transfer process will depend on the arrangement with your current organization â€“ you may need to seek the approval from an authorized representative of your home institution to initiate the transfer. Any additional steps and legal requirements will need to be discussed between your current host organization and OMSF.
