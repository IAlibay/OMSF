At the moment, OMSF allows the following membership categories:
- Hosted Projects – each Hosted Project becomes an OMSF Member upon its acceptance by the Board of Directors. However, the members of Hosted Projects, such as industry partners and academics, do not become the OMSF Members by extension. 
- Sponsor Members – every entity that contributes at least $X for a given year is eligible to become a Sponsor Member, with the membership expiring on Dec 31 of that year (X is set by the Board of Directors). We have no Sponsor Members at this time.
A single Member representing collectively the OMSF Advisory Board, if there is such a Board. We haven’t established an Advisory Board yet.

At the moment, we are trying to change our membership model to so-called “direct membership model”, which would allow companies and individuals to join OMSF as members and participate in the organization's governance. With this model, we could truly become a community-governed institution where interests of both industry and academic researchers would be appropriately represented. We further hope that this change would simplify administrative processes for OMSF and industry partners interested in supporting Hosted Projects, and make it easier to spin up new projects under the OMSF umbrella by the OMSF members. Please find more details about the current membership structure and governance and proposed changes in this document.
