OMSF can host an existing project looking for an organizational home or it can help incubate a new one in collaboration with the project leaders. The OMSF Board of Directors review and approve applications of new potential Hosted Projects to ensure that any new projects are aligned with the OMSFâ€™s mission and tax-exempt purpose. 

We have a form through which existing projects can apply or you can reach out to info@omsf.io to start the conversation. You can also find more information on our website.
