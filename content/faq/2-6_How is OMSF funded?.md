The OMSF charges a fee to each Hosted Project to cover the costs of business administration, back office and legal fees, insurance and management staff. The fee is set annually by the OMSF Board of Directors based on the incurred costs and the number of Hosted Projects as a percentage of the Project’s funding – currently it is set to 10%. We hope to make this fee even lower in the future, but that will depend on the incoming revenue and financial obligations that we might incur as the organization in the future. Each Project will be timely informed about any fee changes and given the opportunity to reduce their costs, if needed, or to move their project to another organization. We are also actively seeking other sources of funding (grants, philanthropy, donations, etc) to expand the range and capacity of our services and bring more value to the community through support of joint efforts and activities.
