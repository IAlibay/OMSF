You might want to:

- Have a centralized administration unit to provide fast and responsive support to your open source project
- Simplify procurement processes for essential tools and services, from software subscriptions to basic equipment
- Grow your team internationally and create positions not supported by your current organization. 
-- OMSF is able to access talent around the world or bring them to the destination of interest. This ability expands the hiring options for distributed teams and makes it more attractive to talented researchers who are not able or willing to relocate. You can also create new positions to support your project and create new career progression paths for your key personnel beyond “eternal postdoc” roles available in academia. 
- Grow your network of collaborators in industry and academia
- Reduce overhead costs
-- We are currently charging a 10% overhead fee, which is significantly lower than academic institution indirect cost rates,which typically range between 50-80%. By being fully remote, we entirely eliminated the facilities costs. We are outsourcing almost all but our core activities to bring the organization cost to a minimum and scale our costs as needed. Our hiring costs are also lower on average compared to the costs of hiring through a university, but that depends on the specific location and mandatory contributions, which vary from country to country. This means that you can offer higher remuneration packages and better benefits to your potential employees for the same amount of money. 
- Receive donations for your project 
-- Please note that OMSF is still waiting for the IRS approval of our tax-exempt status.
- Have access to expert legal advice around open source and insurance.
-- OMSF is also currently working on a set of legal templates that can be easily deployed to form collaborations and establish clear collaboration relationships with universities, research institutions, biotech and pharmaceutical companies, and individual contributors, which will be available to all our Hosted Projects. 
- Share resources and knowledge with other open source projects and researchers
-- This can range from creating joint training materials to sharing a person between different projects, and anything in between. By sharing costs or time burden across multiple projects while working towards a common goal, it is more likely that every project will get what they need at reduced cost.
- Build a different environment around your project and OMSF seems like your natural partner
