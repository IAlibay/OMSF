On the other hand, if your project is hosted by OMSF, but you decided that your project would be better served in another organization or perhaps you are considering setting up your own organization, OMSF is obligated to assist you with transferring your project and all its assets to the new host organization per our By-laws (Section 2.5):

#In the event of a termination or resignation of a Hosted Project Member for any reason, the Foundation shall cooperate in the transition of such Hosted Project to any successor host it may designate, including by transferring all assets of such Hosted Project, net (in the case of cash) of the Foundation's transition costs and non-cancellable obligations on behalf of the Hosted Project.#
