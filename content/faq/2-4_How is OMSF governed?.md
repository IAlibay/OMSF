OMSF was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in Delaware in March 2023 and having by-laws – a set of internal rules for operating the organization – is considered to be best practice for every incorporated nonprofit organization, regardless whether it’s required by the local state law. Per OMSF's by-laws (Section 4), OMSF is governed by the Board of Directors – the minimum number of Directors is one and maximum number is currently set to seven. Four of these seats are “internal seats” dedicated to the Hosted Project representatives. Three “external” seats are reserved for individuals who are not directly involved with OMSF, but who would bring experience and expertise relevant for the success of the organization (legal, business, fundraising, etc). The maximum number of the Directors can be changed by vote of the Board of Directors or by a vote of the Members. The Board also has the authority to make changes to any other provision in the Bylaws. 

Board members are the fiduciaries who steer the organization towards a sustainable future by adopting sound, ethical, and legal governance and financial management policies, as well as by making sure the nonprofit has adequate resources to advance its mission. In practice, that translates into:
- Ensuring that OMSF follows its mission and Bylaws, and that Hosted Projects adhere to their project Charters;
- Voting on new Hosted Projects and making sure that they fit with OMSF’s mission;
- Creating various organizational policies and recommendations (IP policy, Code of Conduct, Conflict of Interest, etc);
- Assisting with fundraising and raising OMSF’s public profile;
- Overseeing organizational activities, finances, executive director’s performance, etc.

OMSF has a Directors & Officers insurance policy to cover liabilities against any potential claims that may arise against the Board members and other officers. 

The Board does not interfere with management of Hosted Projects or their strategic goals, but they are required to provide oversight to all organizational activities and ensure that each project and the organization itself are compliant with all applicable internal and external regulations and policies.
