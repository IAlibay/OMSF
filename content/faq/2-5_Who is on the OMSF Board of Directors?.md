You can find the current members of the Board on our website. The mandates of the current Board members started in March 2022 and each mandate lasts for 2 years. The mandates of Directors are meant to be staggered to ensure continuity and knowledge transfer between incoming and outgoing Directors. We will expand our Board on Jul 1, 2022 with two additional members representing OpenFold and Open Free Energy projects.
