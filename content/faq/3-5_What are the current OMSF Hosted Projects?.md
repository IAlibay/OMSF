OMSF is currently hosting 4 projects:
[OpenFold](http://openfold.io) – Community-governed, open source initiative building state-of-the art AI models for protein structure prediction and beyond.
[Open Force Field](http://openforcefield.org) – An open, collaborative approach to better force fields for biomolecular modeling.
[Open Free Energy](http://openfree.energy) – Open-source tools for binding free energy calculations to guide pharmaceutical drug design and discovery.
[WESTPA](https://westpa.github.io/westpa/) – a high-performance Python framework for applying the weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling strategy, which enables simulations of processes that are orders of magnitude longer than the simulations themselves.

We are also currently discussing potential onboarding of several other open source projects in the field by the end of 2022.
