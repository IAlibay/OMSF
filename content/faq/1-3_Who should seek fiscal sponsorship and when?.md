Projects may seek fiscal sponsorship for various reasons: an anticipated short lifespan, improved access to funding, increased credibility, and low-cost financial and administrative services. Fiscal sponsors can also assist nascent projects in developing the necessary organizational capabilities to eventually spin off as independent non-profits, effectively acting as an “incubator”. Namely, if the project reaches a certain level of maturity and size, it may make sense to spin up an independent entity around that project, especially if the project “outgrows” the capacity of fiscal sponsor to provide adequate support to the growing needs of the project and its community.

Many software projects seek fiscal sponsorship to avoid formation of a legal entity, especially if projects are small or don’t involve large revenues, while receiving necessary administrative support and legal representation when needed. Another reason is fundraising and ability to receive tax-deductible donations in support of the project.
