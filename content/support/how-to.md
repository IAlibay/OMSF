#### a. Hosted Project Member

By joining a Hosted Project of interest, you become the Hosted Project and OMSF member. Any funds received in this way are spent following decisions made by the governing body of the Hosted Project, under the OMSF oversight. Benefits for Hosted Project Members will be specified in the agreement between the Hosted Project and the OMSF. As a Hosted Project Member, you can nominate and vote for candidates to sit on the OMSF Board of Directors.


#### b. Supporting Member

You can become a Supporting Member by contributing at least $100,000 USD in cash or in-kind contributions directly to OMSF. Supporting Members may nominate and vote for candidates to sit on the OMSF Board of Directors.
