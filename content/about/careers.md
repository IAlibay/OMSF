## Open Free Energy Fund
{{% /h2 %}}


The Open Free Energy Fund is an industry-led and highly collaborative effort to build open source infrastructure to support accurate and efficient free energy calculations used in early stages of drug discovery. The Open Free Energy Fund is a newly established program supported by the Open Molecular Software Foundation. More information about the leadership and contributors will be shared on the project's website (coming up soon!).

All positions are currently remote, but placement within a research lab is possible at several locations in the US and Europe. We accept applications worldwide, provided that the OMSF will be able to enter in an appropriate working agreement with the applicant in their country of residence. Please note that you will need to have a valid work permit, as OMSF is not in a position to sponsor any relocation visas at this stage. Additionally, depending on your location, you might occasionally need to participate in meetings outside of normal business hours due to time zone differences. Our industry and academic collaborators are based in Europe and in the United States.

Please reach out to careers@omsf.io for any additional information.
