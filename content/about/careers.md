**About OMSF**

The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is a US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on facilitating collaboration and software development for molecular sciences. OMSF aims to create a cost-effective organization to support an ecosystem of open source projects in molecular sciences, build expertise around managing and governing these projects, explore pathways to sustainability, and accelerate innovation by sharing our knowledge and tools under open licenses.

All OMSF positions are currently remote and we generally accept applications worldwide, provided that the OMSF will be able to enter in an appropriate working agreement with the applicant in their designated country of residence. Some positions may be restricted to the US so please make sure to read the full job description before applying. Please note that you will need to have a valid work permit, as OMSF has a limited ability to sponsor any relocation visas at this stage. Please reach out to discuss visa options, if needed. Depending on your location, you might occasionally need to participate in meetings outside of normal business hours due to time zone differences.

When applying, please use the application forms linked below. Please reach out to careers@omsf.io if you have any additional questions or need help.

**OPEN MOLECULAR SOFTWARE FOUNDATION**

**Role description**

The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is looking for a Community Manager who will grow and support open source communities in molecular sciences. The Community Manager’s duties will center around managing, designing and improving all aspects of communication inside and outside of our organization. The Community Manager will work relentlessly to improve the clarity of communication and accessibility of information and resources to our projects and communities. This includes:
Internal communication within projects and between projects to ensure synergies and gaps are identified and addressed, such as writing reports in collaboration with the project teams;
External communication to ensure the broader community is aware of OMSF’s projects, resources and capabilities, such as designing and maintaining a new website, writing newsletters, blog posts, etc.;
Managing social media channels and forums to ensure our users, contributors and partners have an easy access to information and useful materials, and to each other;
Assisting with and/or organizing online and in-person events to bring together our community members for focused training, hackathons, and networking.

This role is a fully remote, grant-funded position with a minimum duration of 2 years and a possibility of further extension, depending on the available funding.  Please note that, depending on your location, you might occasionally need to participate in meetings outside of normal business hours due to time zone differences. Our teams and collaborators are mostly based in Europe and in the United States.

The Community Manager will work closely with the executive director, project teams, advisory boards, and others to build a strong community of researchers, developers and funders sharing the common goal of improving molecular sciences through open science and open source research software. This is a new role in the organization offering many opportunities to shape up our community and the role itself, and a driven and self-motivated individual would be best suited for the role. The Community Manager will also have access to some training opportunities and resources developed by the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE).
