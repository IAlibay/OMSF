**About OMSF**

The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is a US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on facilitating collaboration and software development for molecular sciences. OMSF aims to create a cost-effective organization to support an ecosystem of open source projects in molecular sciences, build expertise around managing and governing these projects, explore pathways to sustainability, and accelerate innovation by sharing our knowledge and tools under open licenses.

All OMSF positions are currently remote and we generally accept applications worldwide, provided that the OMSF will be able to enter in an appropriate working agreement with the applicant in their designated country of residence. Some positions may be restricted to the US so please make sure to read the full job description before applying. Please note that you will need to have a valid work permit, as OMSF has a limited ability to sponsor any relocation visas at this stage. Please reach out to discuss visa options, if needed. Depending on your location, you might occasionally need to participate in meetings outside of normal business hours due to time zone differences.

When applying, please use the application forms linked below. Please reach out to careers@omsf.io if you have any additional questions or need help.

## POSE: Research Software Engineer & Tech Lead
{{% /h2 %}}

**Job Description**

We are seeking candidates with a passion for improving tools for software development and distribution, and assisting other developers with building better research software for **two positions** funded by the NSF POSE grant recently awarded to OMSF:
- POSE Research Software Engineer (RSE)
- POSE Technical Lead.

The grant will support our efforts in building a resilient open source ecosystem (OSE) in molecular sciences aligned with best practices in software development. Both positions will play a key role in development of packaging, testing automation, and related infrastructure to support OMSF’s open source ecosystem and its developers. More specifically, we are aiming to: 1) improve automated testing for different hardware platforms; 2) make the conda-forge packaging ecosystem more accessible; 3) update a project cookiecutter for easy setup of new open source projects with best practices embedded; and 4) assist projects with growing their own ecosystem of related plugins/kits by documenting best practices for community contributions and developing a simple reusable plugin/kit management platform.

Both roles will require technical experience and contributions to development, maintenance, and integration of these tools for the benefit of the entire ecosystem, as well as assistance with training and knowledge transfer to further build up software development skills in current and future contributors. The Technical Lead role additionally includes strategic planning and oversight, coordinating development efforts, assembling working groups and ensuring community involvement in development of the essential OSE software tools. The POSE RSE and Technical Lead will work closely with OMSF staff, grant collaborators, and broader community members to identify and prioritize the major bottlenecks or challenges in software development in our open source ecosystem, and deliver practical solutions.

These are  2-year positions with a possibility of extension, pending on available funding. Please note that even though the positions are fully remote, the employee will need to be **legally authorized to live and work in the United States.** If you are currently based in the US, but hold a visa sponsored by your current employer, please apply and leave a note that you may require visa assistance. **We will not accept overseas applications for these roles.** The start date will depend primarily on the applicant’s availability, as we would prefer to start as soon as possible. The upcoming holiday season may slow down the hiring process so we ask for your understanding.
