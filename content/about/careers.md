All OMSF positions are currently remote, but placement within a research lab is possible at several locations in the US and Europe through our network of academic collaborators. We accept applications worldwide, provided that the OMSF will be able to enter in an appropriate working agreement with the applicant in their country of residence. Please note that you will need to have a valid work permit, as OMSF currently has a limited ability to sponsor any relocation visas at this stage. Please reach out to discuss visa options, if needed. Depending on your location, you might occasionally need to participate in meetings outside of normal business hours due to time zone differences. Our industry and academic collaborators are based in Europe and in the United States.

When applying, please use the linked forms below. Please reach out to careers@omsf.io if you have any questions or trouble accessing the forms.
